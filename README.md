# IMAGE-COMPRESSION-BMP-IMAGE


This study aims to develop and evaluate an image compression algorithm using wavelet transforms specifically designed for BMP images. Because of the excellent quality and ease of use, bitmap (BMP) images are frequently utilized in various applications. However, these photos are typically uncompressed, resulting in large file sizes unsuitable for efficient transmission and storage. The growing use of high-resolution photographs further exacerbates this inefficiency. Current compression techniques often prove insufficient, either lacking in efficiency or degrading image quality, particularly in real-time applications. Addressing this, our study proposes developing and evaluating an image compression algorithm using wavelet transforms for BMP images. The process involves selecting the appropriate wavelet types and fine-tuning the compression parameters. The effectiveness of this compression will be measure by comparing the size of the BMP image and will be tested on several other BMP image. This research is expected to yield a robust compression technique that maintains high visual fidelity while substantially reducing the size of BMP files, making them more practical for various applications by ensuring quicker transmission and more efficient storage. Additionally, the project aims to provide an easily navigable software tool that facilitates the straightforward integration of this compression technique into existing systems, thereby enhancing its adoption and practical applications.
